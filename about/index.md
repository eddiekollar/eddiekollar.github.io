I am a software engineer, aspiring writer, avid reader, and passionate learner.


From an early age I have been fascinated and inspired by the archetype of the Renaissance Man, an individual skilled and versed in a wide variety of intellectual, physical, and spiritual disciplines. I believe in cultivating a mindset that continually learns, explores, reflects, and shares. This is the ethos that guides me.

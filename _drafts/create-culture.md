> "Culture is not your friend."- Terence McKenna

McKenna [discussion](http://www.refinethemind.com/terence-mckenna-on-culture/)

###What is culture?

To begin to McKenna means to say or any one else who uses the word, let's look at some common definitions  of [culture](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/culture):

>*noun*:
1. The quality in a person or society that arises from a concern for what is regarded as excellent in arts, letters, manners, scholarly pursuits, etc.
2. That which is excellent in the arts, manners, etc.
3. A particular form or stage of civilization, as that of a certain nation or period:
Greek culture.
4. Development or improvement of the mind by education or training.
5. The behaviors and beliefs characteristic of a particular social, ethnic, or age group:
the youth culture; the drug culture.
6. Anthropology. the sum total of ways of living built up by a group of human beings and transmitted from one generation to another.

It is notoriously difficult to define [leaky abstractions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_abstraction) such as culture. At best we can come up with a generalization that applies to most situations or a situation of interest. Particularly with the last three definitions in mind, we can ponder our relationship to culture.

####How does what I consume and interact with influence my behaviors and beliefs?
If we strive to live mindfully in this world then at some point we have to ask question about what it is that we are consuming.
####Does this help develop or improve my mind?
*Root of the word in Latin cult -ure

###Contributing

There are so mant reasons to create and share with the world. What first comes to my mind is that it represents our support for what we value and what we want more of in our lives. Wherever we direct our energies and thoughts we give more power to.

By creating we add to the sum total of our species.

###Connects us

Also it helps us find our tribe, the sub-culture that best represents what we are about.
